# Creating Data Science Web Apps

This is a tutorial that is moreso a set of notes on some tips and tricks learned during a break after the summer semester at JHU. In data science, it could be worth the time to create a simple web app that demonstrates a machine learning tool that has been developed. This can be as simple as creating a Flask web app. However, this tutorial goes deeper by containerizing it with Docker and deploying it with Heroku. Details about these processes and what they are for is explained inside.
